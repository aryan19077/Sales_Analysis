# Sales Analysis Project using SQL and Power BI

## Overview
This project aims to analyze sales data using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The dataset includes information on sales transactions, products, and regions. The analysis focuses on understanding sales trends by year, region, and product category to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Database Schema
The project utilizes a SQL database named `SalesData_Server` with three main tables:

- **Sales**: Contains sales transactions data including date, region, product, quantity, and revenue.
- **Products**: Lists product details such as product ID, name, and category.
- **Regions**: Provides information about different sales regions including region ID and name.

The schema facilitates detailed analysis and aggregation of sales data across different dimensions for comprehensive insights.

## Power BI Visualizations
Power BI is employed to create interactive dashboards and reports that visualize the sales data insights derived from the SQL queries. Key visualizations include:

- **Yearly Sales Trends**: Visualize total revenue and quantity sold trends over the years.
- **Regional Performance**: Compare total revenue and quantity sold across different sales regions.
- **Product Analysis**: Analyze sales performance by product category, showcasing top-selling products and revenue contributions.

These visualizations help stakeholders to quickly grasp trends, patterns, and outliers in sales data, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the SQL database (`SalesData_Server`) is set up and populated with relevant sales data.
2. **SQL Queries**: Execute the provided SQL queries to analyze sales data and extract necessary insights (queries provided separately).
3. **Power BI Integration**: Import data from the SQL database into Power BI Desktop.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports based on the analyzed sales data.
5. **Customization and Sharing**: Customize visualizations as needed and share insights with stakeholders for collaborative decision-making.
